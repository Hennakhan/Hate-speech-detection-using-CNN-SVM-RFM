# Hate-speech-detection-using-SVM-and-CNN-model
In this research two different type of methods Natural Language Processing using multiclass SVM and Deep learning CNN method are used to identify hatespeech.
We are using the dataset provided by TRAC. The data is divided into two task. Task1 - Facebook comments, Task2 - Twitter tweets
The file name for TASK 1 is data-task1.csv and for task 2 it is data-task2.csv.

Run your code 

```shell
# 1. First, clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/Hennakhan/Hate-speech-detection-using-CNN-SVM-RFM-model.git
$ cd Hate-speech-detection-using-CNN-SVM-RFM-model

# 2. Install Python packages
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

#3. Download Word2vec pretrained  model (GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz) and store it in main folder "Hate-speech-detection-using-CNN-SVM-RFM-model"
download from: https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors

# 3. Run!
$ Run jupyter notebook "Task 1 - TextClassification_CNN_SVM_RFM.ipynb" or "Task 2 - TextClassification_CNN_SVM_RFM.ipynb"

#4. Done
```

Note: You can replace the data file with your dataset and change the name of the file you are reading in the beginning (2nd cell) of "Task 1 - TextClassification_CNN_SVM_RFM.ipynb"
